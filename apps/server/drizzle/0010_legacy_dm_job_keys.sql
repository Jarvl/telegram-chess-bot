-- DM notifications spec §2.1: send_dm jobs are keyed per player and game (`dm:{user}:g:{game}`),
-- where they used to be keyed per ply (`…:turn:{ply}`, `…:reminder:{ply}`). Pending jobs queued
-- before the deploy are moved to the new key so they merge with new ones instead of sending twice;
-- where one player and game has several, the newest is kept, since DMs are built from current state.
