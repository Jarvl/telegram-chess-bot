# Piece set attribution

The chess piece glyphs embedded in `pieces.ts` are the **cburnett** set by
[Colin M.L. Burnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cburnett), copied from the files that
lichess.org ships under `public/piece/cburnett` and regenerated with `scripts/vendor-pieces.mjs`.

The author multi-licenses the set on Wikimedia Commons (GFDL, BSD, GPLv2+ and CC BY-SA 3.0);
lichess redistributes its copy under GPLv2+. This project uses the glyphs under the
[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)
terms, as the technical design requires. The only change is that each standalone SVG file was
turned into an inline fragment. Shared position images carry this credit, and the Mini App's
About screen repeats it.

# Font attribution

The text on shared-position images is drawn with Noto Sans, Noto Emoji, Noto Sans Symbols 2,
Noto Sans CJK SC and Young Serif, under the SIL Open Font License 1.1. `apps/server/fonts/README.md` lists each
file's source and copyright; `apps/server/fonts/OFL.txt` is the licence.

# Emoji attribution

The trophy, skull and scales badges in `emoji.ts` are Noto Color Emoji images by Google, from
[googlefonts/noto-emoji](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji) (`2D/svg`, tag
`v2026-09-24-unicode18_0`) under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0),
regenerated with `scripts/vendor-snapshot-art.mjs`. The only change is removing each file's XML
declaration and comments.
