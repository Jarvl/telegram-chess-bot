/**
 * Backfill spec §4.2 steps 3–4: walks a player's counted games, oldest first, and finds the first
 * game at which each candidate's rule holds. Scoring each game on the history up to it is correct
 * because a rule depends only on the game and earlier ones (flair spec §1.6).
 *
 * Moves are read only for a game where a candidate that reads them could hold: any game for `made`,
 * a win for `won` and `quickMate`, a loss for `lost`. They are read at most once per game, and the walk stops as soon as every candidate is found.
