// Fails the image build when the packaged Stockfish is missing, netless or unparseable by our
// adapter. Asserts only that a legal move comes back — never a specific move, an evaluation, a
// mate score or a strength claim, because those are Stockfish's behaviour, not ours, and they
// change between versions (spec §11). Legality is judged by this project's own arbiter, the same
// one that governs real games, not by asserting anything about the engine's choice.
// Imported by relative path, not the `@group-chess/shared` package name: this script lives in
// `scripts/`, outside every workspace package, so the bare specifier has nothing to resolve
// against. `apps/server/src/engine/uci.ts` is imported the same way, but it is a real workspace
// module and resolves its own `@group-chess/shared` and `chess.js` imports normally once loaded.
